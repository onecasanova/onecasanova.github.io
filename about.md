My name is Angel Casanova. I am currently a gradaute student at Johns Hopkins University studying Mechanical Engineering & robotics. I am also an economic enthusaist, I read and study it on my own time. Here is a mini portfolio, or project of mine, with detailed technical analysis and some fundamental analysis too.
