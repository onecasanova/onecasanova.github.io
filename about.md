This is my attempt at gambling my money in the stock market.

My name is Angel Casanova. I am currently a gradaute student at Johns Hopkins University studying mechanical engineering & robotics. I am also an economic enthusaist, I read and study it on my own time. Here I present a mini portfolio, or project of mine, with detailed technical/fundamental analysis of some stocks and how I intend to navigate them.
