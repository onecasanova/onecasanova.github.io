My name is Angel Casanova. I am currently a gradaute student at Johns Hopkins University studying mechanical engineering & robotics. I am also an economic enthusaist, I read and study it on my own time. Here I present a mini portfolio of myself hopefully ecompassing who I am as a person including my interests and hobbies.
