This is my attempt at gambling my money in the stock market.

My name is Angel Casanova. I am currently a gradaute student at Johns Hopkins University studying mechanical engineering & robotics. I am also an economic enthusaist, I read and study it on my own time. Here I present a mini portfolio, or project of mine, with detailed technical/fundamental analysis of some stocks. I'll be investing $100 of my own money to start, but mainly the point is to focus on the returns to see my progress over time. I imagine (if the returns do well) scaling the returns 100x or 1000x to see how much money could be made.
