My name is Angel Casanova. I am currently a gradaute student at The Johns Hopkins University studying mechanical engineering, robotics, and systems engineering. I like to read books on economics, history, and classic literature. I do some embedded systems and IoT as a hobby. I love playing guitar and playing basketball, I find those to be my getaways to a creative space. Here I present a mini portfolio of myself hopefully ecompassing my interests and experiences. If you'd like to contact me, just email me (should be shown at the bottom of the page).
