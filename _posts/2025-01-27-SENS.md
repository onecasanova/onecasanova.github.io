### Transactions

Buy/short:


### Thoughts
(1/14/25) - **Short**. RSI indicates overbought and SMA is diverging from price (or vice versa). MACD shows similar trend to what it did 12-27. I think the price is hitting a top and will topple over. Short Short Short, till RSI evens out.

(1/21/25) - **Short**. Still in overbought region. Moving averages are losing a bit momentum. Maybe wait one or two (max) days to commit to transaction.
