### Dupont Analysis
This method analyzes a company's profitability by breaking down a company's return on equity (ROE) into its component parts, namely: 
* How efficiently it generates profit from sales (profit margin)
* How it utilizes its assets (total asset turnover) 
* How it leverages debt (equity multiplier).

Dupont Analysis says: ROE = Profit Margin x Total Asset Turnover x Equity Multiplier

With this method one can get the fuller picture of a company's overall financial health and performance, on a quarterly basis. Additional metrics were added for more breadth on the company like ROA and Debt-to-Asset ratios.
