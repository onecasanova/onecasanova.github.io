### Transactions

Buy/short: **Buy** $20 on 2/3/25. 


### Thoughts
(2/3/25) - **Buy**. At its 52 week low. From Dupont analysis, the company looks pretty strong and efficient. Quarterly earnings are being released tomorrow as well. If the earnings report comes back good then this will be a great buy, if not then in a couple weeks it will be good to buy the dip and hedge our bets. In addition, the indicators will give hints as to price movement and entry/exit points for this position.
