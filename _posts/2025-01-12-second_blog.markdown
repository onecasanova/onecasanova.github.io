Here I want to try an upload an image. If it gets here then I've done it successfully.


![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/figures/sma.png)



Lets gooooo!

Lets try to use markdown language

### Title One

content... paragraph maybe


### Another title

more content

### another title

it seems like this works as long as there's text in between. It get funky when you try to add hashtags on the next line.
