### Transactions

Buy/short:


### Thoughts
(1/14/25) - **Short**. RSI indicates definitely overbought. But may have to wait for one or two days for correct timing.

(1/21/25) - **Short**. RSI still overbought. Waiting for MACD or MA's to lose momentum to short.

(1/28/25) - **Short**. MACD is about to cross the signal, RSI is just leaving overbought region. Looks like a downtrend is coming for at least a couple days. People are cashing out.

(2/10/25) - **Buy** soon. There was some divergence between SMA and MACD. Looks like there will be a downtrend. When the MACD starts to gain some upward momentum again after this downtrend, confirming with the RSI, then I think this can be a good opportunity to buy. This may not happen though for a couple of days, maybe weeks.
