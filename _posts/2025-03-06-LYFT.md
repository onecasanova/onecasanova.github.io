### Transactions

**Buy**: $20 on 1/22/25

### Thoughts
(1/21/25) - **Buy**. Opportunity here as the 5 day MA is about to cross 20 day. In addition, MACD has upward momentum and the RSI is near median.

(3/7/25) - **Buy**. Look for when SMA and MACD form a valley and buy on the upward momentum. Also look for RSI near or over the overselling region under 30.
