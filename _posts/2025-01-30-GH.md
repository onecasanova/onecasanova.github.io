Buy/short:

### Thoughts
(1/21/25) - **Short**. Today there was a huge spike, not just in price but volume as well. RSi went into overbought region and MACD gained momentum. 

(1/28/25) - **Short**. Price is still climbing while in the overbought region of RSI. It will soon come down at least a little bit in a few days, if not weeks. Then there should be an opportunity to buy.
